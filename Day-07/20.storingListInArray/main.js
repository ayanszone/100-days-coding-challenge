// Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers,
//countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var cities = ["Karachi", "Chennai", "Dehli", "Lahore",];
console.log("Cities i like the most ".concat(cities));
